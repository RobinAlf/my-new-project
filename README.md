# DiscoverAI

#Summary
DiscoverAI is a mobile application designed to enhance the travel experience by alerting users to nearby cultural and historical landmarks. Leveraging AI and geolocation technology, it provides real-time notifications and rich, educational content about each site within a 0-500m radius. Tailored for avid travelers and cultural enthusiasts, DiscoverAI turns every journey into an immersive learning adventure. It gatheres insight from both the IoT but also members with premium access can upload and geotagg their own locations of interest which will be shown to the public after a review from the owner of the application. 

##Data- and AI-technique
The app relies on a combination of real-time geolocation data from the user's smartphone and a rich dataset compiled from Google Maps, Google Places API, Wikipedia, and other cultural heritage databases. By employing NLP techniques, DiscoverAI extracts and processes detailed descriptions of landmarks from various web sources, providing users with insightful content. Machine learning models such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) will predict user preferences to personalize the experience, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) could be used for image recognition to identify and classify images of landmarks uploaded by users. The continuous learning process is supported by feedback loops that refine the model's predictions based on user engagement. There are multiple types of techniques this application would be utilizing to maximize your experience of historical and cultural sites. 

##Problems it will solve
DiscoverAI aims to bridge the gap between travelers and the rich history surrounding them, which often goes unnoticed. It solves the problem of lack of awareness and access to detailed information about cultural sites for tourists and locals alike. By making historical and cultural education accessible and engaging, it promotes cultural preservation and appreciation.

##How is it used
Users, or travelers of any sorts if you like, will interact with DiscoverAI through their mobile devices. As they travel or move through a city, the app runs in the background, using GPS data to trigger notifications when they approach a site of interest. Users can customize their preferences for types of landmarks, historical periods, or art styles they are particularly interested in. The application can be used by anyone with a smartphone with GPS functions, you dont have to be traveling, you can stay at your own town or house checking for interesting places around you. When you move through an area haveing the application engaged it will send you a notice of something nearby depending on your settings and preferences. The AoE or area of effect in which the application can utilize its function can be lowered or prolounged such for instance 0-10m or 0-2000m. 

##Challenges
The primary challenge for DiscoverAI is ensuring the accuracy and relevancy of the information provided. The app must handle a vast amount of data and maintain up-to-date records. Another challenge is user engagement: the app must provide a compelling user experience to encourage frequent use and community contributions. Also choosing the most optimized AI techniques to utilize all functions in the application and ensuring the future state of the application will be both a challenge but also a given, there are multiple AI functions to be implemented into an application like this that already exists in other applications and softwares.

##Whats next
Future developments include integrating augmented reality (AR) to overlay historical facts and figures onto the live camera feed, providing an immersive experience. The app will also incorporate user-generated content and reviews, allowing a community-driven expansion of knowledge. As the user base grows, machine learning algorithms will continuously improve, personalizing the experience and making DiscoverAI an essential companion for every explorer.
